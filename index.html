            <p>  Clownfish got their name from their appearance. The bold orange with thick white stripes that look like they are painted on their scales, similar to the way a clown paints its face. Hence the name “Clownfish."</p>

            Clownfish live in what is called a Sea Anemone, half plant half animal host for these fish. Clownfish cannot survive without a host anemone. There are roughly 1,000 different species of anemones, however only 10 types can host clownfish. These anemones can host and protect several clownfish, but can only have one mating pair at a time. 
            
      <br>
            The Clownfish performs an elaborate dance with the Anemone before deciding if it will be an appropriate host for them. Anemones have tentacles that give off a lethal sting to other creatures, and this is what protects the Clownfish. Wondering how clownfish don't get stung? Clownfish have a layer of mucus on the outside of their scales that protects them from being stung by the hosts tentacles. In return for the anemones protection, the fish clean the anemone of parasites and keep it well groomed. Clownfish are not very adventurous, they are known for only exploring up to a few yards away from their host. </p>

            <p>Clownfish are known for mating all year round. Only two Clownfish, one male and one female can externally fertilize eggs. These interesting creatures are known as "hermaphrodites" which means all clownfish are born male. however, as they mature they turn into a female. Before mating, the male will seek nice coral or rocks near there anemone. He will build a nest safe for the eggs and after they are laid he will protect them. When mating a male clownfish will attract the female by "courting" with her or as we call it flirting. He will chase her, nibble at her, and extend his fins. He will chase her all the way into the nest he has made for her. There the female will lay a batch of hundreds to even thousands of eggs. For the next 4 or 5 days the male will guard the eggs from any harm.</p>

            <p>Cows moo, dogs bark, pigs snort, but what noise does a fish make? Fish are known as a quieter animal because they don't make noises. However, fish actually do make noises and communicate with one another. Typical fish use their swim bladders or rub their bones together to vocalize themselves. Clownfish have a very unique way of communicating. They make chirping and pops that are used to warn off other rival mates. This sounds similar to an old door hinge creaking. Clownfish also raise their heads, shuffle the bones in their mouth and clench their jaws. When male clown fish grind their teeth it is similar to humans using a pick up line.</p>

        <h5> Where can I find a Clownfish?</h5>
        <img src="img/clownfish.live.jpg"> 
    <p> Clownfish are not found in your average body of water. Clownfish are salt water fish that live at the bottom of the sea. These fish fancy warm waters, and are primarily found in the pacific and Indian Ocean.  Less commonly, these fish inhabit regional waters around Northwest Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Indo-Malaysia.</p></div>

        <h5> Traits</h5>
         <img src="img/female.dominant.jpg">
    <p> Clownfish live interesting lives in comparison with other fish. These fish eat mainly isopods but can also be found eating copepods, algae and zooplankton. Within the Clownfish species there is a strict hierarchy of dominance. The largest most aggressive female will be found at the top. She is most powerful and looked at as strong. However, if the head female disappears or dies one of the next largest and most dominant males will begin to mature and slowly become a female.</p>
